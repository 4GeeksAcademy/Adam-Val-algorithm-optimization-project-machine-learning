    "1. **Removal of punctuation marks**: Using `replace` in a loop can be inefficient, especially with long texts. Look for a more efficient way to remove punctuation marks.\n",
    "2. **Frequency count**: The code checks for the existence of each word in the dictionary and then updates its count. This can be done more efficiently with certain data structures in Python.\n",
    "3. **Sort and select:** Consider if there is a more direct or efficient way to get the 5 most frequent words without sorting all the words.\n",
    "4. **Modularity**: Break the code into smaller functions so that each one performs a specific task. This will not only optimize performance, but also make the code more readable and maintainable."
